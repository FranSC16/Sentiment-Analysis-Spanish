# Sentiment Analysis in Spanish

## Overview

This project is my final year project for my Bachelor's degree in Image and Sound Engineering. It involves developing an AI for sentiment analysis in Spanish using a corrected and enhanced dataset of Amazon reviews. The goal of the project is to accurately classify the sentiment of Spanish-language reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Utilizes advanced NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze Spanish text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis Model**: Implements various machine learning algorithms, including deep learning models, to classify sentiment.
- **Data Augmentation**: Employs data augmentation techniques to expand and enhance the dataset, improving model performance.
- **Integration with ChatGPT**: Uses ChatGPT to generate synonyms and expand the dataset, ensuring a robust training set.
- **Model Optimization**: Focuses on optimizing model weights and performance through techniques like Kolmogorov Arnold Networks and BitNets.

## Project Components

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - Collected Spanish-language reviews from Amazon.

   - Performed text preprocessing, including tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal.

2. **Data Augmentation**
   - Developed a custom data augmentation algorithm for NLP.
   - Integrated ChatGPT to generate synonyms and expand the dataset.
   - Ensured the augmented data maintained contextual relevance and accuracy.

3. **Model Development**
   - Experimented with various machine learning models, including traditional classifiers and deep learning architectures.
   - Implemented transformer-based models and convolutional neural networks for sentiment analysis.
   - Optimized models using techniques like Kolmogorov Arnold Networks and BitNets.

4. **Evaluation and Optimization**
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Optimized models to reduce computational load and improve inference speed.
